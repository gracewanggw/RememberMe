# RememberMe

RememberMe aims to help a user remember, review, and relearn the people who matter most.

RememberMe provides quizzing and flashcard functions for the user to refresh their memory about framily (friends + family) members.

They can add profiles for each framily member with information about the person as well as memories associated with each framily member that can be any mixture of pictures, audio, and text.
